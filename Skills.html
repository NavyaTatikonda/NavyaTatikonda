							<br><br>Hey!!! <br>
I'm a Polyglot programmer. :)<br>
I started coding when I was 14. I started with <b>C</b> and currently trying to teach my machine to code in 'C'.<br>
I believe in the metaphor - <i>'Necessity is the mother of Invention'</i>.<br> Being a kid, I was fascinated by the UI/UX of my mom's computer. When I was in my 12<sup>th</sup>, I favoured web technologies over IIT/JEE and self-taught Website designing and developing.
<br>	In result, I did my first freelancing project in my first year of bachelors for a startup and the story continued. That made me a <b>Front-End Engineer</b>. <br>
I started attending alot of Hackathons, Meetups and networking sessions. That made me a better person at <b>PR</b>.
<br>I was equally fascinated by the 'Facebook App'. To be honest,  Mark Zuckerberg is my role model ;) (Not to start a company, but to code)
I wanted to recreate the Facebook App with the same functionality and that made me a <b>LAMP  Stack Developer</b>.
I was furious about Android apps and self-taught the static <b>android application development</b>. <br>In my pre-final year of bachelors, I got a chance to work at a research centre. I worked on <b>Image Processing</b>,<b> Android Development</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b>. I came back and started learning Machine Learning. I was really impressed by the outcome and now here I am with decent knowledge on <b>Web Scraping</b> (I can scrap my own portfolio and give you my skills instead of this paragraph using Beautiful Soup),<b>Data Cleaning</b>,<b> Data Analysis </b>and <b>Data Visualisation</b>. You should check out my projects on <b>Machine learning</b> and<b> Natural Language Processing </b>too :). <br>As a Facebook Developer Circle Lead, I manage a diverse team of 13 and a community of 5500+ members. I am good at <b>Evangelising</b> the technology or the product and as that goes without saying, I'm good at <b>Team Leading & 	Managment</b> too. I am a <b>Product Girl.</b> I love evangelizing the products and making them easy-to-use.<br>
<br><p>These are just my skills, check out my zone window to know about the hackathons that I won!!</p>
Less know the secret of mine, I'm a blogger too.
